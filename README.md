# AI_FireExtinguisherBot

## Overview

The AI_FireExtinguisherBot is a project focused on solving key problems encountered on a spaceship. The bot is designed to handle tasks such as:

- **Fire extinguishing**: Detect and extinguish fires within the spacecraft.
- **Space rat catching**: Locate and capture space rats.
- **Training data**: Involves Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for search algorithms and Neural Network training.

The Python code is hidden from this repo as it contains a solutions to coursework.

## Features

- Implements **search algorithms** to navigate and respond to different conditions.
- Utilizes **neural network training** to handle complex tasks and decision-making.
- Solves critical problems in a spaceship environment.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
- Neural Networks


## Usage

- Run the main bot script to activate the AI bot.
- Ensure that the necessary input files are in place (e.g., environment data, configuration files).
